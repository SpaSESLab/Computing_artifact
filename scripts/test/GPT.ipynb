       "      <td>CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1369 March 31, 2025 \\nto the bond markets because the bond \\nmarkets are basically about to run this \\ncountry. If you have to sell $6 billion a \\nday, $60,000, $70,000 every second, \\nmaybe you need to pay attention to \\nyour bankers who you are having to \\nsell your debt to, to communicate to \\nthose debt markets we are serious and \\nlooking at ways to use technology, bet-\\nter models when obesity is the single \\nbiggest expense in our society. Yes, we \\nare not supposed to say that. Mr. \\nSpeaker, please don’t tell anyone. \\nLast year, the Joint Economic econo-\\nmists calculated $9.1 trillion additional \\nof healthcare spending. Is it moral with \\nwhat we do in food policy, nutritional \\nsupport, how we deliver healthcare? \\nMaybe the concept of helping our \\nbrothers and sisters live healthier \\nwhen 31 percent of Medicare spending \\nis diabetes—33 percent of all healthcare \\noverall is just diabetes. \\nIs that Republican or Democrat? It is \\njust trying to get your policy align-\\nment to the fact we are buried in debt \\nand getting older as a society. I think \\nin a decade, 23 percent of our popu-\\nlation is 65 and up. We now know that \\nwe are having this remarkable short-\\nage of young people. We are already po-\\ntentially on the cusp of having more \\ndeaths than births in our country. \\nIn a couple of weeks, we are trying to \\nroll out a STEM-based, talent-based \\nimmigration bill because for the econ-\\nomy to grow and stabilize, we don’t \\nhave a choice. People say, David, you \\nare not allowed to talk about immigra-\\ntion. People won’t understand it. Well, \\nthey understand the economic survival \\nof you still getting your benefits when \\nyou are a senior. We can make this \\nwork. \\nMr. Speaker, we are now starting to \\nrun into articles saying that we are \\nputting the extraordinary privilege. \\nWhat are the two extraordinary privi-\\nleges America has? Our currency—the \\nworld borrows in our currency, mean-\\ning the fact of the matter is when we \\nsell debt, there is a demand to hold \\nU.S. dollars denominated. Then, the \\nsecond thing is people want to live \\nhere. They want to invest here. They \\nwant to be educated here. They want to \\nbe entrepreneurs here. \\nb 2110 \\nMr. Speaker, we are now running \\ninto multiple articles saying some of \\nthe things we are doing, particularly \\nour debt stack which is putting our ex-\\ntraordinary privilege of the country at \\nrisk. It doesn’t have to be this way. \\nA couple of smart economists say we \\nhave 3 or 4 more years. At that point \\nthe debt gets so hard to manage. The \\nFederal Reserve last week took us from \\na 2.1 GDP down to 1.7. Just that move-\\nment is almost $200 billion a year in \\ntax collection. Just that GDP reduc-\\ntion the Federal Reserve calculated for \\nthe next 3 years, taking that out to 10, \\nthat is more money than everything in \\nour budget reconciliation. \\nThe lack of understanding of the \\ninner dynamics of our debt, the inter-\\nest, and these dollars terrifies me be-\\ncause there is a path. There is a path \\nfor this to work, Mr. Speaker, but we \\nare living on a razor’s edge because we \\nare not doing the hard work. \\nMr. Speaker, I yield back the balance \\nof my time. \\nf \\nHONORING THE LIFE OF REP-\\nRESENTATIVE RAU´ L GRIJALVA \\n(Under the Speaker’s announced pol-\\nicy of January 3, 2025, Mr. ESPAILLAT of \\nNew York was recognized for 30 min-\\nutes.) \\nGENERAL LEAVE \\nMr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I ask \\nunanimous consent that all Members \\nmay have 5 legislative days in which to \\nrevise and extend their remarks and in-\\nclude extraneous material into the \\nrecord. \\nThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there \\nobjection to the request of the gen-\\ntleman from New York? \\nThere was no objection. \\nMr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, to-\\nnight I rise to honor the life and legacy \\nof Congressman Rau´ l Grijalva. \\nRau´ l Grijalva passed away peacefully \\non March 13 of this year, surrounded by \\nhis wife and three daughters. Born in \\nTucson, Arizona, on February 19, 1948, \\nhe was raised in a close-knit commu-\\nnity with his sisters, Lydia and Norma. \\nA proud Sunnyside High graduate, he \\nmet and married the love of his life, \\nRamona Garduno, in 1971. Together, \\nthey raised three daughters: Adelita, \\nRaquel, and Marisa. They built a life \\nrooted in service and activism. \\nHis parents instilled in him the value \\nof hard work, perseverance, and giving \\nback to the community. He dedicated \\nover 50 years to public service, begin-\\nning with the Tucson Unified School \\nBoard in 1974, and later serving on the \\nPima County Board of Supervisors. \\nAs a U.S. Congressman for 22 years, \\nhe championed education, environ-\\nmental protection, social justice, and \\nNative-American sovereignty. His lead-\\nership helped secure the 2023 designa-\\ntion of the Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni \\nNational Monument, protecting nearly \\n1 million acres of Tribal land. \\nKnown as the most liberal Member of \\nCongress, he never wavered in his fight \\nfor justice and equality. He never shied \\naway from that dignified title. \\nA devoted husband, father, and Tata, \\nhe cherished his family and treasured \\ntime with his grandchildren. He had a \\nsharp wit about him, a deep love for \\nmusic and books, and a knack for doo-\\ndling during meetings. Many of us saw \\nhim do his artwork in some our com-\\nmittee meetings. \\nHis staff and volunteers, the \\nGrijalvistas, were like family, standing \\nby him in his lifelong pursuit of \\nprogress. \\nMr. Speaker, the Congressional His-\\npanic Caucus is standing firm with his \\nfamily during this time of sorrow and \\nneed. I know that they are watching \\nthis proceeding. I want to salute them \\nand tell them we love them and we \\nstand with them. \\nRau´ l Grijalva’s unwavering commit-\\nment to justice and his community will \\ncontinue to inspire generations to \\ncome. Since coming to Congress and \\njoining the Natural Resources Com-\\nmittee, Rau´ l Grijalva was one of the \\nmost outspoken champions for environ-\\nmental justice, public lands, indige-\\nnous rights, climate change, and cor-\\nporate accountability. \\nHe was a visionary leader, both on \\nthe committee and as co-chair of the \\nProgressive Caucus, amplifying the \\nvoices of historically silenced commu-\\nnities. From Louisiana’s Cancer Alley \\nto Alaskan Native communities in the \\nArctic, he fought for those most im-\\npacted by environmental harm. \\nUnder his chairmanship in the 117th \\nCongress, the Natural Resources Com-\\nmittee signed 149 natural resource bills \\ninto law. In the minority, he proved \\nthat aggressive and effective oversight \\nwas possible, holding the Trump ad-\\nministration accountable and exposing \\ncorruption. \\nMr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman \\nfrom Texas (Mr. C\\nASTRO). \\nMr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, \\nit is an honor to be here tonight with \\nmembers of the Congressional Hispanic \\nCaucus, and with our Democratic lead-\\ner as well, to celebrate and remember a \\nman who made a difference: Rau ´ l Gri-\\njalva. \\nHe never forgot where he came from. \\nJust as importantly, he never forgot \\nwhy he came. He was somebody who \\nlent a voice to the vulnerable and to \\nthe folks who had been discarded and \\nforgotten. \\nHe was a man of his community. I \\nserved 10 years in Austin in the State \\nlegislature and am now in year 13 here. \\nAs I meet all the people that represent \\nand serve the districts that they do, I \\nalways wonder how closely each person \\nrepresents the average person walking \\ndown the street in their district. Rau ´ l \\nGrijalva was that every person. To me, \\nthat is one of the biggest compliments \\nthat can be paid not only to the people \\nwho sent him here but also to him. \\nHe left the same way he came in, a \\nman of principle who stood up for what \\nhe believed, who fought for the people \\nthat he represented, and always spoke \\ntruth to power. He was a legend of \\nMexican-American activism, known \\nacross the country for protecting our \\nnational parks, the environment, fight-\\ning for early childhood education and \\nhigher education, and uplifting immi-\\ngrants and marginalized communities. \\nAs all of us know, he was also a kind \\nand brilliant man. He had a kind heart \\nbut a fierce spirit. He was a fearless \\nvoice for Arizonans and all Americans. \\nMr. Speaker, Rau´ l will be missed. My \\ncondolences go out to his family and to \\nhis community. \\nMr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I \\nyield to the gentleman from New York \\n(Mr. J\\nEFFRIES). \\nMr. JEFFRIES.

       "      <td>CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSEH1370 March 31, 2025 \\nleadership and for convening us on the \\nfloor today in honor of an iconic, he-\\nroic, and trailblazing Member of Con-\\ngress, Rau´ l Grijalva. \\nIt was an honor for all of us to have \\nhad the opportunity to serve with \\nChairman Grijalva. He was a mentor to \\nmany. His principled leadership was a \\nNorth Star for so many in this Con-\\ngress. He was a leading progressive \\nvoice throughout the years but a friend \\nto all. \\nb 2120 \\nWe know that throughout his time \\nand throughout his journey in public \\nservice it was a journey that led to his \\nworking year after year, decade after \\ndecade, century into century, laboring \\nin the vineyards of his community and \\nultimately the country to make a dif-\\nference in the lives of others who \\nmight otherwise have been left behind. \\nHe was an iconic Mexican-American \\nleader and an iconic American leader. \\nWe are also appreciative of his life, of \\nhis leadership, and of the tremendous \\nlegacy that Congressman Rau´ l Grijalva \\nleaves behind. \\nCongressman Grijalva throughout \\nthe years did many things, from com-\\nmunity organizer to school board mem-\\nber, from school board member to \\ncounty supervisor, from county super-\\nvisor to Member of Congress, from \\nMember of Congress to chairman of the \\nNatural Resources Committee. \\nThrough that journey, year after \\nyear, decade after decade, and century \\ninto century, Rau´ l Grijalva held many \\ntitles. His North Star remained the \\nsame. He was a defender of the disen-\\nfranchised, a voice for the voiceless, a \\nclimate champion, and a powerful, pro-\\nfound, principled, purposeful, and pro-\\ngressive public servant who made a dif-\\nference in the lives of so many people. \\nWe are going to miss Rau ´ l Grijalva. \\nWe will miss his wisdom, we will miss \\nhis insight, we will miss his idealism, \\nand we will miss his laughter and his \\nsense of humor, but we are better off \\nfor having had the opportunity to serve \\nwith him as individuals. \\nMost importantly, his community is \\nbetter off, the State of Arizona is bet-\\nter off, the Congress is better off, and \\nthe country is better off because of \\nRau´ l Grijalva and his incredible leader-\\nship. \\nMr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I \\nyield to the gentleman from Illinois \\n(Mr. G\\nARCI´A). \\nMr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, \\nI thank Chairman E SPAILLAT for yield-\\ning. \\nMr. Speaker, I rise this evening to \\npay tribute to a giant who represented \\nthe State of Arizona and all the people \\nof his district but who also helped ad-\\nvance the well-being of our Nation. \\nArizona has lost a giant, and I lost a \\ndear friend. Rau´ l Grijalva and I both \\nstarted our careers as community ad-\\nvocates and organizers. We shared a \\npassion for justice and equality in our \\ncommunities. We both came from \\nworking-class families, proud of our \\nMexican roots, and we both enjoyed a \\ngood laugh and a good mariachi. So it \\nwas just natural that we would become \\nfriends since I arrived in the House \\nover 6 years ago. \\nAs chairman of the Natural Re-\\nsources Committee, he fought for \\nstrong environmental protections and \\nauthored the Environmental Justice \\nFor All Act to empower people to pro-\\ntect their communities. He wanted a \\ncleaner, safer, and more just future for \\nall our children. He was also a staunch \\ndefender of Tribal sovereignty and \\nworkers’ rights. \\nWhen he was chairman of the Natural \\nResources Committee, he asked me to \\nserve for one term as his vice chair. It \\nwas during that time that Illinois \\nhelped facilitate an act in the State of \\nIllinois that required Federal coopera-\\ntion in that regard as we helped facili-\\ntate the recognition of Illinois’ first \\nPrairie Band of Potawatomi peoples in \\nthe State of Illinois which just last \\nweek resulted in the transfer of over \\n1,500 acres to those Native Americans, \\nthe original inhabitants of the land in \\nIllinois. \\nI was honored to work with him to \\nhelp the people of Puerto Rico receive \\nthe long-promised assistance they \\nneeded after Hurricane Maria. \\nRau´ l believed that our country’s \\nstrength is rooted in our immigrant \\nheritage and worked tirelessly to pro-\\ntect immigrant families and refugees. \\nWhether trying to pass the American \\nDream and Promise Act, treating im-\\nmigrants with dignity or stopping the \\nconstruction of an ineffective and envi-\\nronmentally damaging border wall, \\nRau´ l never gave up. \\nOne of Rau´ l’s favorite songs was ‘‘El \\nRey.’’ It means the king, and in par-\\nticular the line that says: ‘‘It is not \\nonly about getting there first, but \\nabout how you get there,’’ ‘‘No hay que \\nllegar primero, pero hay que saber \\nllegar.’’ \\nAnd what you do along the way, if I \\nmay add. I think this phrase perfectly \\ndescribes the tenacity of everything \\nthat Rau´ l Grijalva did and stood for. \\nRau´ l was a loving father, husband, \\nand a loyal friend. His kindness and \\ndedication will be sorely missed in the \\nHalls of Congress. Tonight we pay a \\ntribute, and we say: Thank you for ev-\\nerything that you contributed to ad-\\nvancing the well-being of people across \\nour land. \\nMr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I \\nyield to the gentleman from California \\n(Mr. G\\nOMEZ). \\nMr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank \\nthe gentleman for allowing me to \\nspeak tonight. \\nI didn’t get to go to Congressman \\nGrijalva’s funeral last week because I \\nhad to be here for a committee hearing. \\nIf he was around, he would have wanted \\nme to stay here and be at that hearing \\nand give them hell. That is exactly \\nwhat I did, and he would have been ex-\\ntremely proud of that. \\nI really wanted to talk about whom I \\nmeet when I was just out of graduate \\nschool. I was a legislative assistant for \\nHilda Solis. I was the lowest ranking \\nstaffer on her team, and I got the \\nchance to meet Rau´ l Grijalva when he \\nwas a Member of Congress and I was \\njust a legislative assistant. \\nTo the extent I walked into the of-\\nfice, I would kind of go wandering \\naround the halls and go and say hello \\nand try to go just to see whom I could \\nbecome friends with. I met his chief of \\nstaff at that time. She said out of the \\nblue: Why don’t you come in and say \\nhello to the Congressman? \\nThey pulled me into the office. I was \\njust a kid who had been here a few \\nmonths. Rau´ l sat with me and just had \\na conversation of who I was, why I was \\nfighting for my community, and why \\ndid I want to be in this business. \\nThat interaction really did sit with \\nme for a number of years. That is be-\\ncause I didn’t have a title. I was not \\nanybody special, and I wasn’t anybody \\nin particular. I was a kid that wan-\\ndered into his office and tried to get a \\nmeeting with him because I said: Why \\nnot? \\nHe is a Member of Congress, but he \\ncomes from a similar background. His \\ndad was a bracero, and my dad was a \\nbracero. That means that they worked \\nin the fields here in the United States. \\nI think there were two or three sons of \\nbraceros who became Members of Con-\\ngress, but it really shows who he is. \\nHe is a guy who will treat you the \\nsame if you are the President or a \\nMember of Congress or a staffer or to \\nsomebody who works in the fields. \\nThat says more about Rau ´ l Grijalva \\nthan I believe any piece of legislation \\nhe has ever passed. \\nWhen I got here, he remembered me \\nas that kid who often was probably a \\nlittle bit too arrogant and a little bit \\nin a rush to move ahead but that he \\nhelped get accustomed to the House of \\nRepresentatives. \\nI was really bummed and sad when \\nwe heard the news that he passed away, \\neven though we kind of all had a feel-\\ning it was a long time coming. He was \\npretty sick. He was a guy whom I think \\na lot of us just loved as family. I think \\nthat is why we see so many people from \\nthe Congressional Hispanic Caucus and \\nother caucus members who went to his \\nfuneral. It is because he was just a \\ngreat guy, someone that we can have a \\nglass of wine with, and somebody that \\nwe can just go and hang out with. \\nI ended up hiring one of his staffers \\nto be one my first chiefs of staff, Ber-\\ntha Guerrero. She loved him to death, \\nand she said that his office was like a \\nfamily. \\nRau´ l, you will be missed. I know you \\nhave done great things, but it is really \\nthe people who you touched over the \\nyears that will continue your legacy, \\nespecially your wife and your daugh-\\nters. \\nb 2130 \\nMr. ESPAILLAT.

Mr. Speaker, it is my privi-\\nlege and honor to recognize and celebrate the \\nremarkable contributions of Congressman \\nRau´l Grijalva—an advocate, a leader, and a \\ntrue champion for our environment, especially \\nthe protection of the most endangered spe-\\ncies. \\nFrom the very beginning of his tenure in \\npublic service, Congressman Grijalva has \\nbeen a tireless advocate for the preservation \\nof our planet’s most vulnerable creatures. \\nWhether it’s a rare desert butterfly, sea turtle, \\nor a small fish, Congressman Grijalva has \\ndedicated his career to ensuring that these \\nspecies—and the ecosystems they inhabit— \\nare protected for generations to come. \\nIn a time when climate change, habitat de-\\nstruction, and human encroachment threaten \\nbiodiversity at unprecedented levels, Con-\\ngressman Grijalva has consistently fought for \\npolicies that safeguard endangered species. \\nAs Chairman and Ranking Member, he has \\nbeen a leading voice on the House Natural \\nResources Committee, pushing for stronger \\nprotections under the Endangered Species Act \\nand advocating for increased funding to sup-\\nport conservation efforts. \\nOne of his most significant accomplishments \\nhas been his leadership in securing critical \\nprotections for species in the Southwestern \\nUnited States, where his home state of Ari-\\nzona sits at the intersection of diverse and \\nfragile ecosystems. Congressman Grijalva has \\nworked tirelessly to preserve the habitats of \\nspecies like the Mexican gray wolf and the \\njaguar, whose survival has been threatened by \\ndeforestation, poaching, and illegal hunting. \\nHis efforts are a testament to his deep com-\\nmitment to preserving not just the species \\nthemselves but also the delicate balance of \\nnature. \\nIn addition to his work on endangered spe-\\ncies, Congressman Grijalva has shown an un-\\nwavering commitment to environmental justice. \\nHe understands that the fight to protect our \\nwildlife goes hand in hand with the fight to \\nprotect our communities—particularly those \\nthat are most vulnerable to environmental deg-\\nradation. He has worked to ensure that con-\\nservation efforts don’t just benefit the wildlife \\nwe cherish but also the people who rely on \\nhealthy ecosystems for their livelihoods and \\nwell-being. \\nCongressman Grijalva’s advocacy has also \\nextended to the legislative arena, where he \\nhas played a crucial role in shaping and pass-\\ning key pieces of legislation aimed at com-\\nbating the extinction crisis. His work in ad-\\nvancing the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act, \\na bill that seeks to fund state-led conservation \\nefforts for atrisk species, has the potential to \\nchange the landscape of wildlife conservation \\nin this country. His vision was clear: we must \\nact now to preserve biodiversity, before more \\nspecies are lost. \\nThrough his leadership, passion, and vision, \\nCongressman Grijalva has not only safe-\\nguarded the lives of endangered species but \\nhas also inspired a new generation of environ-\\nmental advocates to continue the fight for the \\nplanet’s most precious resources. \\nAs we honor Congressman Grijalva, let us \\nreflect on the profound impact his work has \\nhad on the world around us. Let us also renew \\nour own commitment to protecting endangered \\nspecies, preserving their habitats, and ensur-\\ning that future generations will have the oppor-\\ntunity to marvel at the beauty and wonder of \\nour planet’s incredible biodiversity. \\nI thank Congressman Grijalva, for his tire-\\nless dedication to our environment, for our \\nlands, waters, and wildlife, and for making our \\ncountry a cleaner, safer, better place for all \\nAmericans. We worked closely together for \\nmany years on Natural Resources on many \\nimportant issues, and I will always be thankful \\nfor his leadership, partnership, and friendship. \\nHe was a fighter until the end, and his work \\nwill always be remembered by the countless \\npeople it has impacted. \\nAbove all, he was my friend. He always had \\nmy back and could always find a way to make \\nme smile when I was down. He inspired hope \\nin all of us. He fought the good fight. He will \\nbe truly missed. \\nWe are deeply grateful for his service and \\ninspired by his example. His legacy will con-\\ntinue to inspire and guide us in the years to \\ncome. \\nMs. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, \\nit is with a heavy heart that I rise to honor the \\nlife, the work and the legacy of Congressman \\nRau´l Grijalva. \\nWhile others rush to punch down on people \\nwho chase a better life, he was always a \\nbrave, bold voice for Tribes, workers and mi-\\ngrants. \\nAnd he always swung straight and hard at \\nthe powerful who blocked their path. \\nCongressman Grijalva was just as com-\\nfortable demanding environmental justice from \\na Big Oil lobbyist, as he was striking up con-\\nversation with a bus boy at a restaurant. \\nHe served his district, and this Nation, with \\na humility and genuineness that fostered love \\nand respect from anyone who worked with or \\nfor him. \\nHis legacy is long and will not be forgotten. \\nAs a community organizer, local elected offi-\\ncial and leader in Congress, his footprints are \\nall over this nation’s march toward progress. \\nCountless acres around the Grand Canyon \\nand Bears Ears National Monuments are fed-\\nerally protected because of him. \\nHe demanded and won the right to clean \\nland and water for indigenous peoples and all \\nhis constituents. \\nIf you heard demands for urgent climate ac-\\ntion and immigration fairness in Congress, it \\nwas his voice that often rang out. \\nAs Chairman and the lead Democrat on the \\nNatural Resources Committee, Rep. Grijalva \\ninsisted that historic investments be made in \\nour environment and public lands, and that \\nthey touch all communities, not just the well- \\nconnected ones. \\nYour grandchildren will benefit from his push \\nto tackle the climate crisis in the Inflation Re-\\nduction Act. \\nWe all know that the prevailing currency of \\nthis realm is stoking divisions, but Raul Gri-\\njalva built bridges. \\nAs a cancer survivor, I also know how hard \\nthe battle against this terrible disease can be, \\nand his stoic determination in staring it down \\nwhile doing his life’s work was inspiring. \\nHe fought that disease, and for the people \\nhe represented—with grace and dignity. \\nCongressman Grijalva was a mentor to me \\nand so many others. I’m proud to have been \\ntouched by his friendship, and his life of serv-\\nice. May his memory be for a blessing. \\nf \\nADJOURNMENT \\nMr. ESPAILLAT.

If you have to sell $6 billion a \\nday, $60,000, $70,000 every second, \\nmaybe you need to pay attention to \\nyour bankers who you are having to \\nsell your debt to, to communicate to \\nthose debt markets we are serious and \\nlooking at ways to use technology, bet-\\nter models when obesity is the single \\nbiggest expense in our society. Yes, we \\nare not supposed to say that. Mr. \\nSpeaker, please don’t tell anyone. \\nLast year, the Joint Economic econo-\\nmists calculated $9.1 trillion additional \\nof healthcare spending. Is it moral with \\nwhat we do in food policy, nutritional \\nsupport, how we deliver healthcare? \\nMaybe the concept of helping our \\nbrothers and sisters live healthier \\nwhen 31 percent of Medicare spending \\nis diabetes—33 percent of all healthcare \\noverall is just diabetes. \\nIs that Republican or Democrat? It is \\njust trying to get your policy align-\\nment to the fact we are buried in debt \\nand getting older as a society. I think \\nin a decade, 23 percent of our popu-\\nlation is 65 and up. We now know that \\nwe are having this remarkable short-\\nage of young people. We are already po-\\ntentially on the cusp of having more \\ndeaths than births in our country. \\nIn a couple of weeks, we are trying to \\nroll out a STEM-based, talent-based \\nimmigration bill because for the econ-\\nomy to grow and stabilize, we don’t \\nhave a choice. People say, David, you \\nare not allowed to talk about immigra-\\ntion. People won’t understand it. Well, \\nthey understand the economic survival \\nof you still getting your benefits when \\nyou are a senior. We can make this \\nwork. \\nMr. Speaker, we are now starting to \\nrun into articles saying that we are \\nputting the extraordinary privilege. \\nWhat are the two extraordinary privi-\\nleges America has? Our currency—the \\nworld borrows in our currency, mean-\\ning the fact of the matter is when we \\nsell debt, there is a demand to hold \\nU.S. dollars denominated. Then, the \\nsecond thing is people want to live \\nhere. They want to invest here. They \\nwant to be educated here. They want to \\nbe entrepreneurs here. \\nb 2110 \\nMr. Speaker, we are now running \\ninto multiple articles saying some of \\nthe things we are doing, particularly \\nour debt stack which is putting our ex-\\ntraordinary privilege of the country at \\nrisk. It doesn’t have to be this way. \\nA couple of smart economists say we \\nhave 3 or 4 more years. At that point \\nthe debt gets so hard to manage. The \\nFederal Reserve last week took us from \\na 2.1 GDP down to 1.7. Just that move-\\nment is almost $200 billion a year in \\ntax collection. Just that GDP reduc-\\ntion the Federal Reserve calculated for \\nthe next 3 years, taking that out to 10, \\nthat is more money than everything in \\nour budget reconciliation. \\nThe lack of understanding of the \\ninner dynamics of our debt, the inter-\\nest, and these dollars terrifies me be-\\ncause there is a path. There is a path \\nfor this to work, Mr. Speaker, but we \\nare living on a razor’s edge because we \\nare not doing the hard work. \\nMr. Speaker, I yield back the balance \\nof my time. \\nf \\nHONORING THE LIFE OF REP-\\nRESENTATIVE RAU´ L GRIJALVA \\n(Under the Speaker’s announced pol-\\nicy of January 3, 2025, Mr. ESPAILLAT of \\nNew York was recognized for 30 min-\\nutes.) \\nGENERAL LEAVE \\nMr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I ask \\nunanimous consent that all Members \\nmay have 5 legislative days in which to \\nrevise and extend their remarks and in-\\nclude extraneous material into the \\nrecord. \\nThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there \\nobjection to the request of the gen-\\ntleman from New York? \\nThere was no objection. \\nMr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, to-\\nnight I rise to honor the life and legacy \\nof Congressman Rau´ l Grijalva. \\nRau´ l Grijalva passed away peacefully \\non March 13 of this year, surrounded by \\nhis wife and three daughters. Born in \\nTucson, Arizona, on February 19, 1948, \\nhe was raised in a close-knit commu-\\nnity with his sisters, Lydia and Norma. \\nA proud Sunnyside High graduate, he \\nmet and married the love of his life, \\nRamona Garduno, in 1971. Together, \\nthey raised three daughters: Adelita, \\nRaquel, and Marisa. They built a life \\nrooted in service and activism. \\nHis parents instilled in him the value \\nof hard work, perseverance, and giving \\nback to the community. He dedicated \\nover 50 years to public service, begin-\\nning with the Tucson Unified School \\nBoard in 1974, and later serving on the \\nPima County Board of Supervisors. \\nAs a U.S. Congressman for 22 years, \\nhe championed education, environ-\\nmental protection, social justice, and \\nNative-American sovereignty. His lead-\\nership helped secure the 2023 designa-\\ntion of the Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni \\nNational Monument, protecting nearly \\n1 million acres of Tribal land. \\nKnown as the most liberal Member of \\nCongress, he never wavered in his fight \\nfor justice and equality. He never shied \\naway from that dignified title. \\nA devoted husband, father, and Tata, \\nhe cherished his family and treasured \\ntime with his grandchildren. He had a \\nsharp wit about him, a deep love for \\nmusic and books, and a knack for doo-\\ndling during meetings. Many of us saw \\nhim do his artwork in some our com-\\nmittee meetings. \\nHis staff and volunteers, the \\nGrijalvistas, were like family, standing \\nby him in his lifelong pursuit of \\nprogress. \\nMr. Speaker, the Congressional His-\\npanic Caucus is standing firm with his \\nfamily during this time of sorrow and \\nneed. I know that they are watching \\nthis proceeding. I want to salute them \\nand tell them we love them and we \\nstand with them. \\nRau´ l Grijalva’s unwavering commit-\\nment to justice and his community will \\ncontinue to inspire generations to \\ncome. Since coming to Congress and \\njoining the Natural Resources Com-\\nmittee, Rau´ l Grijalva was one of the \\nmost outspoken champions for environ-\\nmental justice, public lands, indige-\\nnous rights, climate change, and cor-\\nporate accountability. \\nHe was a visionary leader, both on \\nthe committee and as co-chair of the \\nProgressive Caucus, amplifying the \\nvoices of historically silenced commu-\\nnities. From Louisiana’s Cancer Alley \\nto Alaskan Native communities in the \\nArctic, he fought for those most im-\\npacted by environmental harm. \\nUnder his chairmanship in the 117th \\nCongress, the Natural Resources Com-\\nmittee signed 149 natural resource bills \\ninto law. In the minority, he proved \\nthat aggressive and effective oversight \\nwas possible, holding the Trump ad-\\nministration accountable and exposing \\ncorruption. \\nMr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman \\nfrom Texas (Mr. C\\nASTRO). \\nMr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Speaker, \\nit is an honor to be here tonight with \\nmembers of the Congressional Hispanic \\nCaucus, and with our Democratic lead-\\ner as well, to celebrate and remember a \\nman who made a difference: Rau ´ l Gri-\\njalva. \\nHe never forgot where he came from. \\nJust as importantly, he never forgot \\nwhy he came. He was somebody who \\nlent a voice to the vulnerable and to \\nthe folks who had been discarded and \\nforgotten. \\nHe was a man of his community. I \\nserved 10 years in Austin in the State \\nlegislature and am now in year 13 here. \\nAs I meet all the people that represent \\nand serve the districts that they do, I \\nalways wonder how closely each person \\nrepresents the average person walking \\ndown the street in their district. Rau ´ l \\nGrijalva was that every person. To me, \\nthat is one of the biggest compliments \\nthat can be paid not only to the people \\nwho sent him here but also to him. \\nHe left the same way he came in, a \\nman of principle who stood up for what \\nhe believed, who fought for the people \\nthat he represented, and always spoke \\ntruth to power. He was a legend of \\nMexican-American activism, known \\nacross the country for protecting our \\nnational parks, the environment, fight-\\ning for early childhood education and \\nhigher education, and uplifting immi-\\ngrants and marginalized communities. \\nAs all of us know, he was also a kind \\nand brilliant man. He had a kind heart \\nbut a fierce spirit. He was a fearless \\nvoice for Arizonans and all Americans. \\nMr. Speaker, Rau´ l will be missed.

He was a mentor to \\nmany. His principled leadership was a \\nNorth Star for so many in this Con-\\ngress. He was a leading progressive \\nvoice throughout the years but a friend \\nto all. \\nb 2120 \\nWe know that throughout his time \\nand throughout his journey in public \\nservice it was a journey that led to his \\nworking year after year, decade after \\ndecade, century into century, laboring \\nin the vineyards of his community and \\nultimately the country to make a dif-\\nference in the lives of others who \\nmight otherwise have been left behind. \\nHe was an iconic Mexican-American \\nleader and an iconic American leader. \\nWe are also appreciative of his life, of \\nhis leadership, and of the tremendous \\nlegacy that Congressman Rau´ l Grijalva \\nleaves behind. \\nCongressman Grijalva throughout \\nthe years did many things, from com-\\nmunity organizer to school board mem-\\nber, from school board member to \\ncounty supervisor, from county super-\\nvisor to Member of Congress, from \\nMember of Congress to chairman of the \\nNatural Resources Committee. \\nThrough that journey, year after \\nyear, decade after decade, and century \\ninto century, Rau´ l Grijalva held many \\ntitles. His North Star remained the \\nsame. He was a defender of the disen-\\nfranchised, a voice for the voiceless, a \\nclimate champion, and a powerful, pro-\\nfound, principled, purposeful, and pro-\\ngressive public servant who made a dif-\\nference in the lives of so many people. \\nWe are going to miss Rau ´ l Grijalva. \\nWe will miss his wisdom, we will miss \\nhis insight, we will miss his idealism, \\nand we will miss his laughter and his \\nsense of humor, but we are better off \\nfor having had the opportunity to serve \\nwith him as individuals. \\nMost importantly, his community is \\nbetter off, the State of Arizona is bet-\\nter off, the Congress is better off, and \\nthe country is better off because of \\nRau´ l Grijalva and his incredible leader-\\nship. \\nMr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I \\nyield to the gentleman from Illinois \\n(Mr. G\\nARCI´A). \\nMr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, \\nI thank Chairman E SPAILLAT for yield-\\ning. \\nMr. Speaker, I rise this evening to \\npay tribute to a giant who represented \\nthe State of Arizona and all the people \\nof his district but who also helped ad-\\nvance the well-being of our Nation. \\nArizona has lost a giant, and I lost a \\ndear friend. Rau´ l Grijalva and I both \\nstarted our careers as community ad-\\nvocates and organizers. We shared a \\npassion for justice and equality in our \\ncommunities. We both came from \\nworking-class families, proud of our \\nMexican roots, and we both enjoyed a \\ngood laugh and a good mariachi. So it \\nwas just natural that we would become \\nfriends since I arrived in the House \\nover 6 years ago. \\nAs chairman of the Natural Re-\\nsources Committee, he fought for \\nstrong environmental protections and \\nauthored the Environmental Justice \\nFor All Act to empower people to pro-\\ntect their communities. He wanted a \\ncleaner, safer, and more just future for \\nall our children. He was also a staunch \\ndefender of Tribal sovereignty and \\nworkers’ rights. \\nWhen he was chairman of the Natural \\nResources Committee, he asked me to \\nserve for one term as his vice chair. It \\nwas during that time that Illinois \\nhelped facilitate an act in the State of \\nIllinois that required Federal coopera-\\ntion in that regard as we helped facili-\\ntate the recognition of Illinois’ first \\nPrairie Band of Potawatomi peoples in \\nthe State of Illinois which just last \\nweek resulted in the transfer of over \\n1,500 acres to those Native Americans, \\nthe original inhabitants of the land in \\nIllinois. \\nI was honored to work with him to \\nhelp the people of Puerto Rico receive \\nthe long-promised assistance they \\nneeded after Hurricane Maria. \\nRau´ l believed that our country’s \\nstrength is rooted in our immigrant \\nheritage and worked tirelessly to pro-\\ntect immigrant families and refugees. \\nWhether trying to pass the American \\nDream and Promise Act, treating im-\\nmigrants with dignity or stopping the \\nconstruction of an ineffective and envi-\\nronmentally damaging border wall, \\nRau´ l never gave up. \\nOne of Rau´ l’s favorite songs was ‘‘El \\nRey.’’ It means the king, and in par-\\nticular the line that says: ‘‘It is not \\nonly about getting there first, but \\nabout how you get there,’’ ‘‘No hay que \\nllegar primero, pero hay que saber \\nllegar.’’ \\nAnd what you do along the way, if I \\nmay add. I think this phrase perfectly \\ndescribes the tenacity of everything \\nthat Rau´ l Grijalva did and stood for. \\nRau´ l was a loving father, husband, \\nand a loyal friend. His kindness and \\ndedication will be sorely missed in the \\nHalls of Congress. Tonight we pay a \\ntribute, and we say: Thank you for ev-\\nerything that you contributed to ad-\\nvancing the well-being of people across \\nour land. \\nMr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I \\nyield to the gentleman from California \\n(Mr. G\\nOMEZ). \\nMr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank \\nthe gentleman for allowing me to \\nspeak tonight. \\nI didn’t get to go to Congressman \\nGrijalva’s funeral last week because I \\nhad to be here for a committee hearing. \\nIf he was around, he would have wanted \\nme to stay here and be at that hearing \\nand give them hell. That is exactly \\nwhat I did, and he would have been ex-\\ntremely proud of that. \\nI really wanted to talk about whom I \\nmeet when I was just out of graduate \\nschool. I was a legislative assistant for \\nHilda Solis. I was the lowest ranking \\nstaffer on her team, and I got the \\nchance to meet Rau´ l Grijalva when he \\nwas a Member of Congress and I was \\njust a legislative assistant. \\nTo the extent I walked into the of-\\nfice, I would kind of go wandering \\naround the halls and go and say hello \\nand try to go just to see whom I could \\nbecome friends with. I met his chief of \\nstaff at that time. She said out of the \\nblue: Why don’t you come in and say \\nhello to the Congressman? \\nThey pulled me into the office. I was \\njust a kid who had been here a few \\nmonths. Rau´ l sat with me and just had \\na conversation of who I was, why I was \\nfighting for my community, and why \\ndid I want to be in this business. \\nThat interaction really did sit with \\nme for a number of years. That is be-\\ncause I didn’t have a title. I was not \\nanybody special, and I wasn’t anybody \\nin particular. I was a kid that wan-\\ndered into his office and tried to get a \\nmeeting with him because I said: Why \\nnot? \\nHe is a Member of Congress, but he \\ncomes from a similar background. His \\ndad was a bracero, and my dad was a \\nbracero. That means that they worked \\nin the fields here in the United States. \\nI think there were two or three sons of \\nbraceros who became Members of Con-\\ngress, but it really shows who he is. \\nHe is a guy who will treat you the \\nsame if you are the President or a \\nMember of Congress or a staffer or to \\nsomebody who works in the fields. \\nThat says more about Rau ´ l Grijalva \\nthan I believe any piece of legislation \\nhe has ever passed. \\nWhen I got here, he remembered me \\nas that kid who often was probably a \\nlittle bit too arrogant and a little bit \\nin a rush to move ahead but that he \\nhelped get accustomed to the House of \\nRepresentatives. \\nI was really bummed and sad when \\nwe heard the news that he passed away, \\neven though we kind of all had a feel-\\ning it was a long time coming. He was \\npretty sick. He was a guy whom I think \\na lot of us just loved as family. I think \\nthat is why we see so many people from \\nthe Congressional Hispanic Caucus and \\nother caucus members who went to his \\nfuneral. It is because he was just a \\ngreat guy, someone that we can have a \\nglass of wine with, and somebody that \\nwe can just go and hang out with. \\nI ended up hiring one of his staffers \\nto be one my first chiefs of staff, Ber-\\ntha Guerrero. She loved him to death, \\nand she said that his office was like a \\nfamily. \\nRau´ l, you will be missed. I know you \\nhave done great things, but it is really \\nthe people who you touched over the \\nyears that will continue your legacy, \\nespecially your wife and your daugh-\\nters. \\nb 2130 \\nMr. ESPAILLAT.

       "2  CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE H1371 March 31, 2025 \\nHe championed full, permanent fund-\\ning for the Land and Water Conserva-\\ntion Fund, achieving its passage in the \\nGreat American Outdoors Act of 2020. \\nHe led the A. Donald McEachin Envi-\\nronmental Justice For All Act, the \\nmost comprehensive environmental \\njustice legislation ever. \\nHis Ocean-Based Climate Solutions \\nAct laid the foundations for protecting \\ncoastal communities and promoting \\nclean offshore energy. \\nThe RESPECT Act sought to codify \\nTribal consultation standards and \\nstrengthen our nation-to-nation rela-\\ntionships. \\nThe Puerto Rico Status Act, which \\nhe helped pass in the House, rep-\\nresented a historic step toward self-de-\\ntermination. \\nI was also proud to work with him on \\nseveral pieces of legislation, including \\nlegislation to provide student loan re-\\nlief to teachers who specialized in \\nteaching English-language learners, \\nlike myself as a kid; legislation to in-\\ncrease funding to English-language \\nlearner preparation programs; and get-\\nting the GAO to study how schools \\nidentify English-language learners \\nwith disabilities to ensure they have \\nthe right support behind them. \\nHe also secured the passage of the \\nGreat American Outdoors Act, perma-\\nnently authorizing the Land and Water \\nConservation Fund. \\nHis leadership helped pass major \\nocean and climate action provisions in \\nthe Inflation Reduction Act and other \\nlandmark legislation. \\nHe held the first congressional hear-\\nings on issues like missing and mur-\\ndered indigenous women in Indian \\nboarding schools. \\nHis work on the Puerto Rico Status \\nAct helped advance the conversation \\non the island’s political future. \\nRau´ l Grijalva’s legacy is one of un-\\nwavering advocacy, principled leader-\\nship, and a deep commitment to jus-\\ntice. \\n‘‘We will never forget you, Rau ´ l’’; \\n‘‘Rau´ l, nos vas a ser mucho falta. \\nNunca olvidaremos.’’ Rest in power, \\nhermano. \\nHis impact will be felt for genera-\\ntions. \\nMr. Speaker, I yield back the balance \\nof my time. \\nMrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, it is my privi-\\nlege and honor to recognize and celebrate the \\nremarkable contributions of Congressman \\nRau´l Grijalva—an advocate, a leader, and a \\ntrue champion for our environment, especially \\nthe protection of the most endangered spe-\\ncies. \\nFrom the very beginning of his tenure in \\npublic service, Congressman Grijalva has \\nbeen a tireless advocate for the preservation \\nof our planet’s most vulnerable creatures. \\nWhether it’s a rare desert butterfly, sea turtle, \\nor a small fish, Congressman Grijalva has \\ndedicated his career to ensuring that these \\nspecies—and the ecosystems they inhabit— \\nare protected for generations to come. \\nIn a time when climate change, habitat de-\\nstruction, and human encroachment threaten \\nbiodiversity at unprecedented levels, Con-\\ngressman Grijalva has consistently fought for \\npolicies that safeguard endangered species. \\nAs Chairman and Ranking Member, he has \\nbeen a leading voice on the House Natural \\nResources Committee, pushing for stronger \\nprotections under the Endangered Species Act \\nand advocating for increased funding to sup-\\nport conservation efforts. \\nOne of his most significant accomplishments \\nhas been his leadership in securing critical \\nprotections for species in the Southwestern \\nUnited States, where his home state of Ari-\\nzona sits at the intersection of diverse and \\nfragile ecosystems. Congressman Grijalva has \\nworked tirelessly to preserve the habitats of \\nspecies like the Mexican gray wolf and the \\njaguar, whose survival has been threatened by \\ndeforestation, poaching, and illegal hunting. \\nHis efforts are a testament to his deep com-\\nmitment to preserving not just the species \\nthemselves but also the delicate balance of \\nnature. \\nIn addition to his work on endangered spe-\\ncies, Congressman Grijalva has shown an un-\\nwavering commitment to environmental justice. \\nHe understands that the fight to protect our \\nwildlife goes hand in hand with the fight to \\nprotect our communities—particularly those \\nthat are most vulnerable to environmental deg-\\nradation. He has worked to ensure that con-\\nservation efforts don’t just benefit the wildlife \\nwe cherish but also the people who rely on \\nhealthy ecosystems for their livelihoods and \\nwell-being. \\nCongressman Grijalva’s advocacy has also \\nextended to the legislative arena, where he \\nhas played a crucial role in shaping and pass-\\ning key pieces of legislation aimed at com-\\nbating the extinction crisis. His work in ad-\\nvancing the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act, \\na bill that seeks to fund state-led conservation \\nefforts for atrisk species, has the potential to \\nchange the landscape of wildlife conservation \\nin this country. His vision was clear: we must \\nact now to preserve biodiversity, before more \\nspecies are lost. \\nThrough his leadership, passion, and vision, \\nCongressman Grijalva has not only safe-\\nguarded the lives of endangered species but \\nhas also inspired a new generation of environ-\\nmental advocates to continue the fight for the \\nplanet’s most precious resources. \\nAs we honor Congressman Grijalva, let us \\nreflect on the profound impact his work has \\nhad on the world around us. Let us also renew \\nour own commitment to protecting endangered \\nspecies, preserving their habitats, and ensur-\\ning that future generations will have the oppor-\\ntunity to marvel at the beauty and wonder of \\nour planet’s incredible biodiversity. \\nI thank Congressman Grijalva, for his tire-\\nless dedication to our environment, for our \\nlands, waters, and wildlife, and for making our \\ncountry a cleaner, safer, better place for all \\nAmericans. We worked closely together for \\nmany years on Natural Resources on many \\nimportant issues, and I will always be thankful \\nfor his leadership, partnership, and friendship. \\nHe was a fighter until the end, and his work \\nwill always be remembered by the countless \\npeople it has impacted. \\nAbove all, he was my friend. He always had \\nmy back and could always find a way to make \\nme smile when I was down. He inspired hope \\nin all of us. He fought the good fight. He will \\nbe truly missed. \\nWe are deeply grateful for his service and \\ninspired by his example. His legacy will con-\\ntinue to inspire and guide us in the years to \\ncome. \\nMs. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, \\nit is with a heavy heart that I rise to honor the \\nlife, the work and the legacy of Congressman \\nRau´l Grijalva. \\nWhile others rush to punch down on people \\nwho chase a better life, he was always a \\nbrave, bold voice for Tribes, workers and mi-\\ngrants. \\nAnd he always swung straight and hard at \\nthe powerful who blocked their path. \\nCongressman Grijalva was just as com-\\nfortable demanding environmental justice from \\na Big Oil lobbyist, as he was striking up con-\\nversation with a bus boy at a restaurant. \\nHe served his district, and this Nation, with \\na humility and genuineness that fostered love \\nand respect from anyone who worked with or \\nfor him. \\nHis legacy is long and will not be forgotten. \\nAs a community organizer, local elected offi-\\ncial and leader in Congress, his footprints are \\nall over this nation’s march toward progress. \\nCountless acres around the Grand Canyon \\nand Bears Ears National Monuments are fed-\\nerally protected because of him. \\nHe demanded and won the right to clean \\nland and water for indigenous peoples and all \\nhis constituents. \\nIf you heard demands for urgent climate ac-\\ntion and immigration fairness in Congress, it \\nwas his voice that often rang out. \\nAs Chairman and the lead Democrat on the \\nNatural Resources Committee, Rep. Grijalva \\ninsisted that historic investments be made in \\nour environment and public lands, and that \\nthey touch all communities, not just the well- \\nconnected ones. \\nYour grandchildren will benefit from his push \\nto tackle the climate crisis in the Inflation Re-\\nduction Act. \\nWe all know that the prevailing currency of \\nthis realm is stoking divisions, but Raul Gri-\\njalva built bridges. \\nAs a cancer survivor, I also know how hard \\nthe battle against this terrible disease can be, \\nand his stoic determination in staring it down \\nwhile doing his life’s work was inspiring. \\nHe fought that disease, and for the people \\nhe represented—with grace and dignity. \\nCongressman Grijalva was a mentor to me \\nand so many others. I’m proud to have been \\ntouched by his friendship, and his life of serv-\\nice. May his memory be for a blessing. \\nf \\nADJOURNMENT \\nMr. ESPAILLAT.

Yes, we are not supposed to say that. Mr. Speaker, please don’t tell anyone. Last year, the Joint Economic economists calculated $9.1 trillion additional of healthcare spending. Is it moral with what we do in food policy, nutritional support, how we deliver healthcare? Maybe the concept of helping our brothers and sisters live healthier when 31 percent of Medicare spending is diabetes—33 percent of all healthcare overall is just diabetes. Is that Republican or Democrat? It is just trying to get your policy alignment to the fact we are buried in debt and getting older as a society. I think in a decade, 23 percent of our population is 65 and up. We now know that we are having this remarkable shortage of young people. We are already potentially on the cusp of having more deaths than births in our country. In a couple of weeks, we are trying to roll out a STEM-based, talent-based immigration bill because for the economy to grow and stabilize, we don’t have a choice. People say, David, you are not allowed to talk about immigration. People won’t understand it. Well, they understand the economic survival of you still getting your benefits when you are a senior.

It doesn’t have to be this way. A couple of smart economists say we have 3 or 4 more years. At that point the debt gets so hard to manage. The Federal Reserve last week took us from a 2.1 GDP down to 1.7. Just that movement is almost $200 billion a year in tax collection. Just that GDP reduction the Federal Reserve calculated for the next 3 years, taking that out to 10, that is more money than everything in our budget reconciliation. The lack of understanding of the inner dynamics of our debt, the interest, and these dollars terrifies me because there is a path. There is a path for this to work, Mr. Speaker, but we are living on a razor’s edge because we are not doing the hard work.</td>\n",

If you have to sell $6 billion a day, $60,000, $70,000 every second, maybe you need to pay attention to your bankers who you are having to sell your debt to, to communicate to those debt markets we are serious and looking at ways to use technology, better models when obesity is the single biggest expense in our society. Yes, we are not supposed to say that. Mr. Speaker, please don’t tell anyone. Last year, the Joint Economic economists calculated $9.1 trillion additional of healthcare spending. Is it moral with what we do in food policy, nutritional support, how we deliver healthcare? Maybe the concept of helping our brothers and sisters live healthier when 31 percent of Medicare spending is diabetes—33 percent of all healthcare overall is just diabetes. Is that Republican or Democrat? It is just trying to get your policy alignment to the fact we are buried in debt and getting older as a society. I think in a decade, 23 percent of our population is 65 and up. We now know that we are having this remarkable shortage of young people. We are already potentially on the cusp of having more deaths than births in our country. In a couple of weeks, we are trying to roll out a STEM-based, talent-based immigration bill because for the economy to grow and stabilize, we don’t have a choice. People say, David, you are not allowed to talk about immigration. People won’t understand it. Well, they understand the economic survival of you still getting your benefits when you are a senior. We can make this work.  \n",

What are the two extraordinary privileges America has? Our currency—the world borrows in our currency, meaning the fact of the matter is when we sell debt, there is a demand to hold U.S. dollars denominated. Then, the second thing is people want to live here. They want to invest here. They want to be educated here. They want to be entrepreneurs here.  \n",

It doesn’t have to be this way. A couple of smart economists say we have 3 or 4 more years. At that point the debt gets so hard to manage. The Federal Reserve last week took us from a 2.1 GDP down to 1.7. Just that movement is almost $200 billion a year in tax collection. Just that GDP reduction the Federal Reserve calculated for the next 3 years, taking that out to 10, that is more money than everything in our budget reconciliation. The lack of understanding of the inner dynamics of our debt, the interest, and these dollars terrifies me because there is a path. There is a path for this to work, Mr. Speaker, but we are living on a razor’s edge because we are not doing the hard work.  \n",

Yes, we are not supposed to say that. Mr. Speaker, please don’t tell anyone. Last year, the Joint Economic economists calculated $9.1 trillion additional of healthcare spending. Is it moral with what we do in food policy, nutritional support, how we deliver healthcare? Maybe the concept of helping our brothers and sisters live healthier when 31 percent of Medicare spending is diabetes—33 percent of all healthcare overall is just diabetes. Is that Republican or Democrat? It is just trying to get your policy alignment to the fact we are buried in debt and getting older as a society. I think in a decade, 23 percent of our population is 65 and up. We now know that we are having this remarkable shortage of young people. We are already potentially on the cusp of having more deaths than births in our country. In a couple of weeks, we are trying to roll out a STEM-based, talent-based immigration bill because for the economy to grow and stabilize, we don’t have a choice. People say, David, you are not allowed to talk about immigration. People won’t understand it. Well, they understand the economic survival of you still getting your benefits when you are a senior.

The Federal Reserve last week took us from a 2.1 GDP down to 1.7. Just that movement is almost $200 billion a year in tax collection. Just that GDP reduction the Federal Reserve calculated for the next 3 years, taking that out to 10, that is more money than everything in our budget reconciliation. The lack of understanding of the inner dynamics of our debt, the interest, and these dollars terrifies me because there is a path.

Rau´ l Grijalva passed away peacefully on March 13 of this year, surrounded by his wife and three daughters. Born in Tucson, Arizona, on February 19, 1948, he was raised in a close-knit community with his sisters, Lydia and Norma. A proud Sunnyside High graduate, he met and married the love of his life, Ramona Garduno, in 1971. Together, they raised three daughters: Adelita, Raquel, and Marisa. They built a life rooted in service and activism. His parents instilled in him the value of hard work, perseverance, and giving back to the community. He dedicated over 50 years to public service, beginning with the Tucson Unified School Board in 1974, and later serving on the Pima County Board of Supervisors. As a U.S. Congressman for 22 years, he championed education, environmental protection, social justice, and Native-American sovereignty. His leadership helped secure the 2023 designation of the Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni National Monument, protecting nearly 1 million acres of Tribal land. Known as the most liberal Member of Congress, he never wavered in his fight for justice and equality. He never shied away from that dignified title. A devoted husband, father, and Tata, he cherished his family and treasured time with his grandchildren. He had a sharp wit about him, a deep love for music and books, and a knack for doodling during meetings. Many of us saw him do his artwork in some our committee meetings. His staff and volunteers, the Grijalvistas, were like family, standing by him in his lifelong pursuit of progress.</td>\n",

Since coming to Congress and joining the Natural Resources Committee, Rau´ l Grijalva was one of the most outspoken champions for environmental justice, public lands, indigenous rights, climate change, and corporate accountability. He was a visionary leader, both on the committee and as co-chair of the Progressive Caucus, amplifying the voices of historically silenced communities. From Louisiana’s Cancer Alley to Alaskan Native communities in the Arctic, he fought for those most impacted by environmental harm. Under his chairmanship in the 117th Congress, the Natural Resources Committee signed 149 natural resource bills into law. In the minority, he proved that aggressive and effective oversight was possible, holding the Trump administration accountable and exposing corruption.</td>\n",

He never forgot where he came from. Just as importantly, he never forgot why he came. He was somebody who lent a voice to the vulnerable and to the folks who had been discarded and forgotten. He was a man of his community. I served 10 years in Austin in the State legislature and am now in year 13 here. As I meet all the people that represent and serve the districts that they do, I always wonder how closely each person represents the average person walking down the street in their district. Rau ´ l Grijalva was that every person. To me, that is one of the biggest compliments that can be paid not only to the people who sent him here but also to him. He left the same way he came in, a man of principle who stood up for what he believed, who fought for the people that he represented, and always spoke truth to power. He was a legend of Mexican-American activism, known across the country for protecting our national parks, the environment, fighting for early childhood education and higher education, and uplifting immigrants and marginalized communities. As all of us know, he was also a kind and brilliant man. He had a kind heart but a fierce spirit. He was a fearless voice for Arizonans and all Americans.</td>\n",

If you have to sell $6 billion a day, $60,000, $70,000 every second, maybe you need to pay attention to your bankers who you are having to sell your debt to, to communicate to those debt markets we are serious and looking at ways to use technology, better models when obesity is the single biggest expense in our society. Yes, we are not supposed to say that. Mr. Speaker, please don’t tell anyone. Last year, the Joint Economic economists calculated $9.1 trillion additional of healthcare spending. Is it moral with what we do in food policy, nutritional support, how we deliver healthcare? Maybe the concept of helping our brothers and sisters live healthier when 31 percent of Medicare spending is diabetes—33 percent of all healthcare overall is just diabetes. Is that Republican or Democrat? It is just trying to get your policy alignment to the fact we are buried in debt and getting older as a society. I think in a decade, 23 percent of our population is 65 and up. We now know that we are having this remarkable shortage of young people. We are already potentially on the cusp of having more deaths than births in our country. In a couple of weeks, we are trying to roll out a STEM-based, talent-based immigration bill because for the economy to grow and stabilize, we don’t have a choice. People say, David, you are not allowed to talk about immigration. People won’t understand it. Well, they understand the economic survival of you still getting your benefits when you are a senior. We can make this work.   \n",

What are the two extraordinary privileges America has? Our currency—the world borrows in our currency, meaning the fact of the matter is when we sell debt, there is a demand to hold U.S. dollars denominated. Then, the second thing is people want to live here. They want to invest here. They want to be educated here. They want to be entrepreneurs here.   \n",

It doesn’t have to be this way. A couple of smart economists say we have 3 or 4 more years. At that point the debt gets so hard to manage. The Federal Reserve last week took us from a 2.1 GDP down to 1.7. Just that movement is almost $200 billion a year in tax collection. Just that GDP reduction the Federal Reserve calculated for the next 3 years, taking that out to 10, that is more money than everything in our budget reconciliation. The lack of understanding of the inner dynamics of our debt, the interest, and these dollars terrifies me because there is a path. There is a path for this to work, Mr. Speaker, but we are living on a razor’s edge because we are not doing the hard work.   \n",

       "6  night I rise to honor the life and legacy of Congressman Rau´ l Grijalva. Rau´ l Grijalva passed away peacefully on March 13 of this year, surrounded by his wife and three daughters. Born in Tucson, Arizona, on February 19, 1948, he was raised in a close-knit community with his sisters, Lydia and Norma. A proud Sunnyside High graduate, he met and married the love of his life, Ramona Garduno, in 1971. Together, they raised three daughters: Adelita, Raquel, and Marisa. They built a life rooted in service and activism. His parents instilled in him the value of hard work, perseverance, and giving back to the community. He dedicated over 50 years to public service, beginning with the Tucson Unified School Board in 1974, and later serving on the Pima County Board of Supervisors. As a U.S. Congressman for 22 years, he championed education, environmental protection, social justice, and Native-American sovereignty. His leadership helped secure the 2023 designation of the Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni National Monument, protecting nearly 1 million acres of Tribal land. Known as the most liberal Member of Congress, he never wavered in his fight for justice and equality. He never shied away from that dignified title. A devoted husband, father, and Tata, he cherished his family and treasured time with his grandchildren. He had a sharp wit about him, a deep love for music and books, and a knack for doodling during meetings. Many of us saw him do his artwork in some our committee meetings. His staff and volunteers, the Grijalvistas, were like family, standing by him in his lifelong pursuit of progress.   \n",

I know that they are watching this proceeding. I want to salute them and tell them we love them and we stand with them. Rau´ l Grijalva’s unwavering commitment to justice and his community will continue to inspire generations to come. Since coming to Congress and joining the Natural Resources Committee, Rau´ l Grijalva was one of the most outspoken champions for environmental justice, public lands, indigenous rights, climate change, and corporate accountability. He was a visionary leader, both on the committee and as co-chair of the Progressive Caucus, amplifying the voices of historically silenced communities. From Louisiana’s Cancer Alley to Alaskan Native communities in the Arctic, he fought for those most impacted by environmental harm. Under his chairmanship in the 117th Congress, the Natural Resources Committee signed 149 natural resource bills into law. In the minority, he proved that aggressive and effective oversight was possible, holding the Trump administration accountable and exposing corruption.   \n",

He never forgot where he came from. Just as importantly, he never forgot why he came. He was somebody who lent a voice to the vulnerable and to the folks who had been discarded and forgotten. He was a man of his community. I served 10 years in Austin in the State legislature and am now in year 13 here. As I meet all the people that represent and serve the districts that they do, I always wonder how closely each person represents the average person walking down the street in their district. Rau ´ l Grijalva was that every person. To me, that is one of the biggest compliments that can be paid not only to the people who sent him here but also to him. He left the same way he came in, a man of principle who stood up for what he believed, who fought for the people that he represented, and always spoke truth to power. He was a legend of Mexican-American activism, known across the country for protecting our national parks, the environment, fighting for early childhood education and higher education, and uplifting immigrants and marginalized communities. As all of us know, he was also a kind and brilliant man. He had a kind heart but a fierce spirit. He was a fearless voice for Arizonans and all Americans.   \n",

From the very beginning of his tenure in public service, Congressman Grijalva has been a tireless advocate for the preservation of our planet’s most vulnerable creatures. Whether it’s a rare desert butterfly, sea turtle, or a small fish, Congressman Grijalva has dedicated his career to ensuring that these species—and the ecosystems they inhabit— are protected for generations to come. In a time when climate change, habitat destruction, and human encroachment threaten biodiversity at unprecedented levels, Congressman Grijalva has consistently fought for policies that safeguard endangered species. As Chairman and Ranking Member, he has been a leading voice on the House Natural Resources Committee, pushing for stronger protections under the Endangered Species Act and advocating for increased funding to support conservation efforts. One of his most significant accomplishments has been his leadership in securing critical protections for species in the Southwestern United States, where his home state of Arizona sits at the intersection of diverse and fragile ecosystems. Congressman Grijalva has worked tirelessly to preserve the habitats of species like the Mexican gray wolf and the jaguar, whose survival has been threatened by deforestation, poaching, and illegal hunting. His efforts are a testament to his deep commitment to preserving not just the species themselves but also the delicate balance of nature. In addition to his work on endangered species, Congressman Grijalva has shown an unwavering commitment to environmental justice. He understands that the fight to protect our wildlife goes hand in hand with the fight to protect our communities—particularly those that are most vulnerable to environmental degradation. He has worked to ensure that conservation efforts don’t just benefit the wildlife we cherish but also the people who rely on healthy ecosystems for their livelihoods and well-being. Congressman Grijalva’s advocacy has also extended to the legislative arena, where he has played a crucial role in shaping and passing key pieces of legislation aimed at combating the extinction crisis. His work in advancing the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act, a bill that seeks to fund state-led conservation efforts for atrisk species, has the potential to change the landscape of wildlife conservation in this country. His vision was clear: we must act now to preserve biodiversity, before more species are lost. Through his leadership, passion, and vision, Congressman Grijalva has not only safeguarded the lives of endangered species but has also inspired a new generation of environmental advocates to continue the fight for the planet’s most precious resources. As we honor Congressman Grijalva, let us reflect on the profound impact his work has had on the world around us. Let us also renew our own commitment to protecting endangered species, preserving their habitats, and ensuring that future generations will have the opportunity to marvel at the beauty and wonder of our planet’s incredible biodiversity. I thank Congressman Grijalva, for his tireless dedication to our environment, for our lands, waters, and wildlife, and for making our country a cleaner, safer, better place for all Americans. We worked closely together for many years on Natural Resources on many important issues, and I will always be thankful for his leadership, partnership, and friendship.

       "20  lege and honor to recognize and celebrate the remarkable contributions of Congressman Rau´l Grijalva—an advocate, a leader, and a true champion for our environment, especially the protection of the most endangered species. From the very beginning of his tenure in public service, Congressman Grijalva has been a tireless advocate for the preservation of our planet’s most vulnerable creatures. Whether it’s a rare desert butterfly, sea turtle, or a small fish, Congressman Grijalva has dedicated his career to ensuring that these species—and the ecosystems they inhabit— are protected for generations to come. In a time when climate change, habitat destruction, and human encroachment threaten biodiversity at unprecedented levels, Congressman Grijalva has consistently fought for policies that safeguard endangered species. As Chairman and Ranking Member, he has been a leading voice on the House Natural Resources Committee, pushing for stronger protections under the Endangered Species Act and advocating for increased funding to support conservation efforts. One of his most significant accomplishments has been his leadership in securing critical protections for species in the Southwestern United States, where his home state of Arizona sits at the intersection of diverse and fragile ecosystems. Congressman Grijalva has worked tirelessly to preserve the habitats of species like the Mexican gray wolf and the jaguar, whose survival has been threatened by deforestation, poaching, and illegal hunting. His efforts are a testament to his deep commitment to preserving not just the species themselves but also the delicate balance of nature. In addition to his work on endangered species, Congressman Grijalva has shown an unwavering commitment to environmental justice. He understands that the fight to protect our wildlife goes hand in hand with the fight to protect our communities—particularly those that are most vulnerable to environmental degradation. He has worked to ensure that conservation efforts don’t just benefit the wildlife we cherish but also the people who rely on healthy ecosystems for their livelihoods and well-being. Congressman Grijalva’s advocacy has also extended to the legislative arena, where he has played a crucial role in shaping and passing key pieces of legislation aimed at combating the extinction crisis. His work in advancing the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act, a bill that seeks to fund state-led conservation efforts for atrisk species, has the potential to change the landscape of wildlife conservation in this country. His vision was clear: we must act now to preserve biodiversity, before more species are lost. Through his leadership, passion, and vision, Congressman Grijalva has not only safeguarded the lives of endangered species but has also inspired a new generation of environmental advocates to continue the fight for the planet’s most precious resources. As we honor Congressman Grijalva, let us reflect on the profound impact his work has had on the world around us. Let us also renew our own commitment to protecting endangered species, preserving their habitats, and ensuring that future generations will have the opportunity to marvel at the beauty and wonder of our planet’s incredible biodiversity. I thank Congressman Grijalva, for his tireless dedication to our environment, for our lands, waters, and wildlife, and for making our country a cleaner, safer, better place for all Americans. We worked closely together for many years on Natural Resources on many important issues, and I will always be thankful for his leadership, partnership, and friendship. He was a fighter until the end, and his work will always be remembered by the countless people it has impacted. Above all, he was my friend. He always had my back and could always find a way to make me smile when I was down. He inspired hope in all of us. He fought the good fight. He will be truly missed. We are deeply grateful for his service and inspired by his example. His legacy will continue to inspire and guide us in the years to come.   \n",
